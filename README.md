def LongestCommonSubsequences(old_line, new_line):
    """
    This function finds the Longest Common Subsequences (LCS) between two lines of text,
    and generates commit data based on the changes between the lines.

    Args:
        old_line (str): The original line of text.
        new_line (str): The modified line of text.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two elements:

                - common_word (str): The common word between the lines.
                - old_line_index (int): The index of the common word in the old line.
                - new_line_index (int): The index of the common word in the new line.
            - commit_data (list): A list containing two lists:
                - insertions (list): A list of tuples representing inserted words. Each tuple contains:
                    - word (str): The inserted word.
                    - index (int): The index where the word was inserted in the new line.
                - deletions (list): A list of tuples representing deleted words. Each tuple contains:
                    - word (str): The deleted word.
                    - index (int): The index where the word was present in the old line.

```
#### Description:

This function implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the longest sequence of words that appear in both the `old_line` and the `new_line`. It then uses the LCS information to generate commit data that reflects the changes made between the two lines.
The commit data consists of two lists:
- `insertions`: A list of tuples containing the words that were inserted in the new_line compared to the old_line.
- `deletions`: A list of tuples containing the words that were deleted from the old_line when compared to the new_line.

#### Algorithm:

1. **Split Lines**: The function first splits both `old_line` and `new_line` into lists of individual words.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: It then uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the length of the LCS. A 2D DP table (`dp`) is used to store the LCS length for all possible sub-problems.
3. **Backtracking**: After finding the LCS length, the function backtracks through the DP table to reconstruct the actual LCS sequence. It retrieves the common words along with their corresponding indices in both the original and modified lines.
4. **Generate Commit Data**: Finally, it uses the LCS information to identify insertions and deletions. Words present in the `new_line` but not in the LCS are considered insertions, while words present in the `old_line` but not in the LCS are considered deletions.

#### Example Usage:
```
old_line = "This is the old line."
new_line = "This is a modified line."

lcs, commit_data = LongestCommonSubsequences(old_line, new_line)
print("Longest Common Subsequence:", lcs)
print("Commit Data:", commit_data)
```
This indicates that "a modified" were inserted in the new line, while "old" was deleted from the old line.

### File: reconstruct.py
This file defines functions for reconstructing new versions of files based on their original content and commit data generated by the `passport` system.

#### Functions
- **reconstruct(old_line, commit_data_line):**
  - **Description:**
    - Takes the original line of text (`old_line`) and its corresponding commit data (`commit_data_line`) as input.
    - Generates the new line of text after applying the changes specified in the commit data.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `old_line` (str): The original line of text.
    - `commit_data_line` (list): A list containing two lists:
      - `insertions` (list): A list of inserted words in the new line.
      - `deletions` (list): A list of deleted words from the old line.
  - **Return Value:**
    - `str`: The reconstructed line of text with insertions and deletions applied.
- **reconstruct_file(old_file_location, commit_data):**
  - **Description:**
    - Reconstructs a new version of a file based on its original location (`old_file_location`) and the commit data (`commit_data`) associated with that file.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `old_file_location` (str): The path to the original file.
    - `commit_data` (list): A list of commit data lines corresponding to each line in the original file.
  - **Return Value:**
    - `list`: A list of strings representing the reconstructed lines of the new file

#### Notes:
- Both functions assume that the `commit_data` format is valid and aligns with the structure generated by the `lcs.LongestCommonSubsequences` function.
- The `reconstruct_file` function handles cases where the lengths of the original lines and the commit data might differ due to insertions or deletions.
- The `reconstruct_file` function includes basic error handling to print an error message in case of unexpected issues.

#### Example Usage:
```
# Assuming you have commit data generated for a file

old_file_location = "my_file.txt"
commit_data = [# List of commit data lines for each original line in the file]

new_file_content = reconstruct_file(old_file_location, commit_data)

# Write the reconstructed content to a new file (optional)
with open("my_file_new.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(new_file_content)
```

### File: commit_data_file.py
```
def commit_data_file(old_file_location, new_file_location):
    """
    This function generates commit data for a file based on the differences between its original and modified versions.

    Args:
        old_file_location (str): The path to the original file.
        new_file_location (str): The path to the modified file.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping line numbers (integers) to their corresponding commit data (lists). The commit data list contains two sub-lists:
            - insertions (list): A list of inserted words in the new line.
            - deletions (list): A list of deleted words from the old line.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If either the original or modified file location is invalid.
    """
```
#### Description:
This function takes the paths to the original and modified versions of a file as input. It then performs the following steps:
1. **Validate File Locations:**
   - Uses `os.path.abspath` to ensure absolute paths for both files.
   - Checks if both files exist using `os.path.exists`.
   - If either file is not found, displays an error message using the `terminal_output` module (assumed) and exits the program.
2. **Read File Contents:**
   - Opens the original and modified files using `open`.
   - Reads the lines from each file and removes trailing newline characters using `rstrip("\n")`.
   - Closes the files.
4. **Generate Commit Data:**
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `commit_data` to store line-wise commit data.
   - Iterates through a maximum of the lengths of the original and modified lines:
     - Handles potential index errors by using `try-except` blocks.
     - Gets the corresponding lines from the original (`old_line`) and modified (`new_line`) files.
     - Calls the `LCS.LongestCommonSubsequences` function from the `lcs` module to find the LCS and generate commit data (`cd`).
     - Stores the commit data for the current line (`i`) in the `commit_data` dictionary.
6. **Return Commit Data:**
   - Returns the `commit_data` dictionary containing commit data for each line.
#### Example Usage:
```
old_file_location = "path/to/old_file.txt"
new_file_location = "path/to/new_file.txt"

commit_data = commit_data_file(old_file_location, new_file_location)

# Use the commit_data for further processing or storage within the "passport" system
```
This example demonstrates how to use the commit_data_file function to generate commit data for a file based on its original and modified versions.
